        When installed, a card is added to the sidebar on company records in
        HubSpot. In addition to technologies, you'll also see any email
        addresses, phone numbers, social media profiles, trackers and website
        meta data we have on record.
      </p>

      <v-alert :icon="mdiLightbulbOnOutline" class="mt-6" outlined>
        HubSpot fetches technology data from Wappalyzer every time you view a
        company record. When you uninstall the Wappalyzer app, this information
        is longer available.

      <p>
        A lookup costs 1 credit. A lookup happens when you view a company record
        in HubSpot. Subsequent lookups for the same record are free for one day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The HubSpot integration is available on any paid plan. When you have no
        remaining credits, no new lookups will be performed until you top-up
        your account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refer to the <nuxt-link to="/pricing/">Pricing</nuxt-link> page for more
        information about credits and plans.
