      </p>

      <p>
        When installed, a panel is added to the sidebar on people and
        organisations in Pipedrive showing the technologies on used on their
        website.
      </p>

      <v-alert :icon="mdiLightbulbOnOutline" class="mt-6" outlined>
        Pipedrive fetches technology data from Wappalyzer every time you view a
        person or organisation. When you uninstall the Wappalyzer app, this
        information is longer available.
      </v-alert>

      You can also permanently enrich all organisation records at once with a
      sync, and automatically update new records using a webhook. This
      information is yours to keep and can be used to create custom reports in
      Pipedrive.

      <p>
        For people, Wappalyzer uses the persons's email address to determine the
        website domain and show the technologies in use for that website.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Wappalyzer data to show up on organisations in Pipedrive, you must
        first specify which custom field is used to store the organisation's
        website.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Pipedrive settings, go to
        <v-chip small>Data fields</v-chip>
        &rarr; <v-chip small>Organization</v-chip> &rarr;
        <v-chip small>Custom fields</v-chip> and create or find a custom field
        that contains the website URL for organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Select the field on the
        <nuxt-link to="/integrations/pipedrive/"
          >Pipedrive integration page</nuxt-link

      <p>
        A lookup costs 1 credit. A lookup happens when you view a person or
        organisation in Pipedrive. Subsequent lookups for the same record are
        free for one day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Pipedrive integration is available on Team and Business plans. When
        you have no remaining credits, no new lookups can be performed until you
        top-up your account.
